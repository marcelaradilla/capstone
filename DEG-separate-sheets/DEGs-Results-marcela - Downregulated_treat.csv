Table of downregulated genes,,,,,,,Table of gene symbols and names for downregulated genes,,,,,,
This table was created by taking the consistently expressed genes in all 4 datasets and filtering for log2FC<-1 and p vlaue<0.05 in the limma output for Dataset 1. ,,,,,,,This table was created by taking the geneID column from the table on the left and looking for the genes in BIOGPS. ,,,,,,
logFC: estimate of the log2-fold-change corresponding to the contrast,AveExpr: average log2-expression for the probe over all arrays and channels,t: moderated t-statistic,P.Value: raw p-value,adj.P.Val: ajusted p-value,"Gene ID: affy probe ID, these were used to look for the gene symbols in BIOGPS ",,,the affy probe ID taken from geneID column from table on the left,Gene symbol,Gene ID,,,
